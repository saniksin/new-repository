[Verse 1]
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me, yeah
Ooh, I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see

[Chorus]
Oh, now I see
Now I see, yeah
I was blind
Oh, but now I see

[Verse 2]
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fear relieved, yeah
Now how precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

[Chorus]
Oh, now I see
Now I see, yeah
I was blind
Oh, but now I see
Hey!

[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 3]
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
We have already come
Twas grace that brought us safe thus far
And grace will lead us home (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Now I see
Now I see, yeah
I was blind, yeah
But now I see
Ooh, yeah, I was blind, yeah
But now I see, yeah
I was blind
But now I see
